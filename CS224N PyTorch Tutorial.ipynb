        "## Introduction\n",
        "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a machine learning framework that is used in both academia and industry for various applications. PyTorch started of as a more flexible alternative to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), which is another popular machine learning framework. At the time of its release, `PyTorch` appealed to the users due to its user friendly nature: as opposed to defining static graphs before performing an operation as in `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch` allowed users to define their operations as they go, which is also the approached integrated by `TensorFlow` in its following releases. Although `TensorFlow` is more widely preferred in the industry, `PyTorch` is often times the preferred machine learning framework for researchers. \n",

        "Now that we have learned enough about the background of `PyTorch`, let's start by importing it into our notebook. To install `PyTorch`, you can follow the instructions here. Alternatively, you can open this notebook using `Google Colab`, which already has `PyTorch` installed in its base kernel. Once you are done with the installation process, run the following cell:"
