In one pass (meaning a call to `forward()`), our model will try to generate the correct label for one word. Let's say our model is trying to generate the correct label `1` for `Paris`.

Now, this raises another issue. `Paris` is at the end of our sentence, so there isn't another word following it. Remember that we define the input dimensions of our `PyTorch` models when we are initializing them.

It is called as follows `nn.Embedding(num_words, embedding_dimension)` where `num_words` is the number of words in our vocabulary and the `embedding_dimension` is the dimension of the embeddings we want to have. There is nothing fancy about `nn.Embedding`: it is just a wrapper class around a trainable `NxE` dimensional tensor, where `N` is the number of words in our vocabulary and `E` is the number of embedding dimensions. This table is initially random, but it will change over time. As we train our network, the gradients will be backpropagated all the way to the embedding layer, and hence our word embeddings would be updated. We will initiliaze the embedding layer we will use for our model in our model, but we are showing an example here."
